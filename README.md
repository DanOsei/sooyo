Iit is mostly targeted to yoga lovers, to those who find it relaxing and liberal to do yoga once in a while ask stress free practise an even to those who are not into yoga but curious about it. As revealed in my projects the websites it's not focused on normal yoga, but mostly practising yoga in the nature outdoors and trying to stimulate our senses connecting us to our environments.
