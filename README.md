# SooYoga

SooYoga is a website dedicated to yoga lovers but with a different touch of atmosphere environment and lighting it being an outdoor yoga classes, blending the safety and distance of virtual classes with the communal and energy-building nature of in-person classes
Iit is mostly targeted to yoga lovers, to those who find it relaxing and liberal to do yoga once in a while ask stress free practise an even to those who are not into yoga but curious about it. As revealed in my projects the websites it's not focused on normal yoga, but mostly practising yoga in the nature outdoors and trying to stimulate our senses connecting us to our environments.
Sooyoga classes gives you also the adventure of discovering gnu natural locations near your neighbour-hood, where you wouldnâ€™t even imagine possible to practise yoga and find peace and harmony in the daily life routine.
